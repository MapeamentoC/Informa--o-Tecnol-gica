body aestheticsTHE COLEMAN™ MICROINJECTION SYSTEM Three styles and two sizes have been developed to perform soft tissue infiltration.CANNULA COLEMAN™ Infiltration Cannula Configured to allow passage of aspirant optimally sized for each infiltration procedure.COLEMAN™ Aspiration Cannula An atraumatic "V" channel at the distal tip helps disrupt soft tissue for controlled release of adhesions and ligamentous connections.COLEMAN™ "V" Dissector Cannula The COLEMAN™ Style Mini Infiltration Cannula is ideal for areas requiring precise control.
Available in two sizes, I (19 ga) and II (20 ga).COLEMAN™ Style Mini Infiltration CannulaDesigned to access difficult deep or superficial graft sites, these concave and convex shaft styles are available with Style I, II and III tips.COLEMAN™ Contour SeriesThe COLEMAN™ Microinjection System is an innovative concept in instrumentation that assists with microinfiltration procedures including donor site preparation, removal and preparation of aspirant, and precise infiltration at the recipient site.
Designed by Dr. Sydney Coleman and perfected in clinical use, this instrumentation offers everything you need for small volume fat transfer procedures.THE COLEMAN™ MICROINJECTION SYSTEM Positive connections assure a leak proof fit to luer lock syringes during the refinement process.
Caps are designed to withstand the fluid pressures generated during centrifugation.
TIP STYLES THE COLEMAN™ MICROINJECTION SYSTEM Designed to hold 1cc, 3cc and 10cc syringes, this autoclavable rack is used by Dr. Coleman to facilitate preparation and counting during his procedure.COLEMAN™ Syringe Rack The MediLite®* Centrifuge is capable of spinning six 10cc syringes simultaneously at 3100 rpm.
Rotor and tubes are autoclavable.MediLite®* CentrifugeCOLEMAN™ Syringe Caps COLEMAN™ Style I features a blunt closed end distally, with a single opening.
COLEMAN™ Style II features a blunt end, but is more open distally and laterally than Style I.
The Style II is the cannula most frequently used by Dr. Coleman.
COLEMAN™ Style III is open and "flattened" distally, and is used by Dr. Coleman when working superficially.
Coleman™ "V" Dissector Cannula has an atraumatic "V" channel at the distal tip.
