These particularly aect in v estmen ts in inno v ation pro jects as suc h pro jects are t ypically c haracterized b y a high degree of uncertain t y , complexit y and sp ecicit y .
Financing inno v ation externally is th us lik ely to b e more costly compared to nancing of other in v estmen t. Hence, in ternal sources of nancing are crucial for the implemen tation of inno v ation pro jects.
Ho w ev er, in ternal funds are not inexhaustible either.
They are naturally limited and raising new equit y ma y b e costly and often undesired.
Financing constrain ts, ho w ev er, ma y not aect all rms to the same exten t. This pap er addresses the question of whic h rms face nancing constrain ts.
Suc h iden tication is particularly in teresting for p olicy mak ers in order to design eectiv e p olicy sc hemes as nancing constrain ts lead to a sub optimal lev el of in v estmen t in inno v ation.
In con trast to previous empirical studies, our analysis is based on the idea of an ideal test for iden tifying nancial constrain ts on in v estmen t in inno v ation as prop osed b y Hall (2008).
She suggests that 'the ideal exp erimen t for iden tifying the eects of liquidit y constrain ts on in v estmen t is to giv e rms additional cash exogenously , and observ e whether they pass it on to shareholders or use it for in v estmen t and/or R&D.
If they c ho ose the second [alternativ e], then the rm m ust ha v e had some unexploited in v estmen t opp ortunities that w ere not protable using more costly external nance'.
That is, these rms ha v e b een nancially constrained.
This study con tributes to the literature in the follo wing three main asp ects.

Third, w e in tro duce the concept of inno v ativ e capabilit y and ho w it aects nancing constrain ts for inno v ation.
The results from our econometric analysis sho w that nancial constrain ts for inno v ation do not dep end on the a v ailabilit y of funds p er se, but are driv en b y inno v ativ e capabilit y through increasing resource requiremen ts.
That is, rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y but lo w nancial resources are more lik ely constrained than others.

T aking accoun t of all options for usage of the additional money , w e further nd in con trast to the inno v ation decision, the decision to serv e debt is to a large exten t driv en b y the nancial bac kground.
Firms with lo w in ternal funds or a bad credit rating w ould primarily repa y debt instead of in v esting additional cash in inno v ation pro jects.Das Wic h tigste in Kürze Un v ollk ommenen Kapitalmärkte führen dazu, dass sic h Un ternehmen Einsc hränkungen b ei der Finanzierung v on In v estitionsv orhab en gegen üb ersehen.

Firms w ere oered a h yp othetical pa ymen t and w ere ask ed to c ho ose b et w een alternativ es of use.
If they selected additional inno v ation pro jects, they m ust ha v e had some unexploited inv estmen t opp ortunities that w ere not protable using more costly external nance.
W e attribute constrain ts for inno v ation not only to lac king nancing, but also to rms' innov ativ e capabilit y .
Econometric results sho w that nancial constrain ts do not dep end on the a v ailabilit y of in ternal funds p er se, but that they are driv en b y inno v ativ e capabilit y .

An y errors remain those of the authors.1 Intro duction In economic researc h and p olicy practice it is a widely accepted view that inno v ation constitutes an imp ortan t driving force of rm-lev el pro ductivit y , comp etitiv eness, and sustainable economic gro wth.1Consequen tly , it is a concern for b oth p olicy mak ers and industry practitioners that nancing constrain ts due to imp erfections in capital mark ets reduce in v estmen ts in inno v ation b elo w desired lev els.
In v estmen t in inno v ation ma y b e particularly aected b y nancial constrain ts since information asymmetries exist due to the complexit y , sp ecicit y , and high degree of uncertain t y of inno v ation pro jects.
This mak es it dicult for outsiders to judge the pro jects' p oten tial v alue.
Moreo v er, rms ma y b e reluctan t to rev eal details of inno v ation pro jects to prosp ect in v estors.
Therefore, nancing inno v ation externally ma y b e more costly compared to other in v estmen ts.2Internal sources of nancing are th us crucial for the implemen tation of inno v ation pro jects.3 Ho w ev er, in ternal funds are not inexhaustible either.
Cash o w is naturally limited and raising new equit y ma y b e costly and often un w an ted.4 Financing constrain ts, ho w ev er, ma y not aect all rms to the same exten t. The iden tication of constrained rms is particularly in teresting for p olicy mak ers in order to design eectiv e p olicy sc hemes aimed at prev en ting w elfare-reducing sub optimal in v estmen t in inno v ation.
In con trast to previous empirical studies whic h tested the presence of nancing constrain ts indirectly b y the sensitivit y of in v estmen t in researc h and dev elopmen t (R&D) to c hanges in in ternal funds, this study tak es a direct approac h. It is based on the concept of an ideal test for iden tifying nancial constrain ts on in v estmen t in inno v ation as prop osed b y Hall (2008).
She suggests that "the ideal exp erimen t for iden tifying the eects of liquidit y constrain ts on in v estmen t is to giv e rms additional cash exogenously , and observ e whether they pass it on to shareholders or use it for in v estmen t and/or R&D.
If they c ho ose the second, then the rm m ust ha v e had some unexploited in v estmen t opp ortunities that w ere not protable using more costly external nance".
That is, these rms had b een nancially constrained.
This study con tributes to the literature in three main asp ects.
First, w e emplo y a direct indicator deriv ed from surv ey information.
Firms w ere ask ed to imagine that they receiv e additional cash exogenously and to indicate ho w they w ould sp end it.
F rom this w e directly observ e whether rms c ho ose to in v est either all or part of the cash in additional inno v ation pro jects.
Second, our econometric analysis accoun ts for the rms' c hoice b et w een alternativ e uses of the money .
Suc h an approac h is crucial b ecause in v esting in inno v ation pro jects comp etes with other purp oses of rms' a v ailable funds.
Third, w e in tro duce the concept of inno v ativ e capabilit y and ho w it aects nancing constrain ts for inno v ation.
T o the b est of our kno wledge, this fundamen tal asp ect of a rm's inno v ation pro cess has attracted little atten tion in this strand of literature so far.
The econometric results sho w that nancial constrain ts do not dep end on the a v ailabilit y of in ternal funds p er se, but that they are driv en b y inno v ativ e capabilit y through increasing resource requiremen ts.
Firms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y but lo w nancial 1resources are most lik ely to b e constrained.
Y et, w e also observ e constrain ts for nancially sound rms that ma y ha v e to put some of their ideas on the shelf.
T aking accoun t of all options for using additional money , the m ultidimensional analysis rev eals some further in teresting results.
F or example, rms with bad credit ratings w ould primarily repa y their debt.
This article briey reviews previous researc h in section 2.
Section 3 describ es the theoretical framew ork of our study and sets out the role of inno v ativ e capabilit y for nancing constrain ts.

2 Financing Constraints fo r Innovation: What do w e Kno w?
In principle there are t w o sources for nancing inno v ation pro jects.
External sources include bank loans or other debt con tracts whereas in ternal sources basically originate from retained prots or (new) equit y .
In their seminal article Mo digliani and Miller (1958) sho w that in mark ets that are c haracterized b y no taxes, no bankruptcy costs, and no asymmetric information, in v estmen t decisions are indieren t to capital structure.
Hence, in a neo-classical w orld with frictionless mark ets sources of nancing w ould not matter.
Ho w ev er, starting with the w ork of Arro w (1962) and Nelson (1959) n umerous articles ha v e elab orated on the reasons wh y the source of nancing matters and wh y it particularly matters for in v estmen ts in inno v ation (Stiglitz and W eiss 1981, Stiglitz 1985, Green w ald, Stiglitz and W eiss 1984, Bhattac hary a and Ritter 1983, An ton and Y ao 2002).
Information asymmetries that arise due to the sp ecic c haracteristics of inno v ation cause lenders or in v estors to demand a 'premium' on their required rate of return in the sense of Ak erlof (1970).
Besides information asymmetries, the in tangible nature of the asset that is b eing created b y R&D usually mak es external fund raising more costly than for other t yp es of in v estmen t. A large fraction of inno v ation in v estmen ts, particularly R&D, is sunk and cannot b e redeplo y ed.
Debt holders suc h as banks prefer ph ysical and redeplo y able assets as securit y for their loans since these can b e liquidated in case of pro ject failure or bankruptcy (Williamson 1988, Alderson and Betk er 1996).
Moreo v er, serving debt requires a stable cash o w whic h mak es nancing of inno v ation pro jects b y external sources more dicult since most of these pro jects do not immediately lead to returns.
In addition, serving debt reduces cash o w for future in v estmen ts (see Hall 1992, 2002).
Empirical evidence corrob orates that rms rst and foremost use in ternal funds to nance inno v ation pro jects (as compared to debt) indicating a gap in the resp ectiv e cost of capital (Leland and Pyle 1977, Bhattac hary a and Ritter 1983, Hall 1990, 1992, Himmelb erg and P eterson 1994, Bougheas, Görg and Strobl 2003, Czarnitzki and Hottenrott 2011b).
In ternal funds, ho w ev er, are naturally limited and raising new equit y ma y b e 2costly and often un w an ted.
Consequen tly , the exten t to whic h nancial constrain ts are binding dep ends on the rms' abilit y to raise funds under the conditions of imp erfect capital mark ets.
Measuring and iden tifying nancial constrain ts represen ts a main c hallenge in empirical researc h. Since the seminal w ork of F azzari, Hubbard and P etersen (1988), econometric studies ha v e tried to detect nancial constrain ts b y analyzing in v estmen ts' sensitivities to c hanges in a v ailable nancial resources, most often cash o w. Excess sensitivities w ere regarded as indirectly reecting the rms' lac k of access to the credit mark et.5This metho dology has subsequen tly b een applied to in v estmen t in R&D.
Theoretical literature states that asymmetric information, moral hazard in b orro w er-lendership, in tra-rm organizational structure and other institutional factors ma y lead to nancial constrain ts.
They are th us exp ected to dep end on certain pro ject, rm, and institutional c haracteristics.
In order to observ e more than an a v erage eect, researc hers usually split their sample or fo cus on a particular group of rms a priori.6Financing constrain ts for R&D w ere found to dep end on certain pro ject and rm c haracteristics.
Empirical studies, ho wev er, ha v e not alw a ys pro vided unam biguous results (see Hall 2002, 2008 and Hall and Lerner 2010 for surv eys of the literature).
Most of these empirical studies suer from limitations in data a v ailabilit y .
Man y of them lo ok at either large, sto c k mark et rms or at exceptionally small rms.
More sev ere limitations arise from the conceptual set-up.
Kaplan and Zingales (1997, 2000) rst questioned whether the relationship b et w een cash o w and in v estmen t is a sucien t indication of nancial constrain ts (see also Cleary 1999, F azzari et al.
2000, A ydogan 2003 and Mo y en 2004).
Esp ecially in the case of large rms free cash o w lev els ma y b e determined b y accoun ting as w ell as dividend p olicies aimed at mitigating moral hazard problems (Jensen and Mec kling 1976, Jensen 1986, Dhanani 2005).
A dditionally , a p ositiv e relationship b et w een in v estmen t and cash o w ma y simply reect that b oth of them correlate with promising mark et demand.
Finally , rms tend to smo oth R&D sp ending o v er time leading to diculties in measuring the impact of c hanges in cash in one p erio d on subsequen t in v estmen ts (Hall, Grilic hes and Hausman 1986, Lac h and Sc hank erman 1988).
Consequen tly , recen t studies in v estigate rms' access to external funds more directly through the analysis of standardized credit ratings (Czarnitzki 2006, Czarnitzki and Hottenrott 2011a,b) or credit requests (Piga and A tzeni 2007).
The main concern using credit requests, ho w ev er, relates to a selectivit y problem.
The most constrained rms ma y not exp ect to get external funding and hence not ask for it.
Moreo v er, in previous studies rms that ha v e not b een inno v ativ e in the past due to a constrain t ma y not b e paid the necessary atten tion to.
As an alternativ e, Aghion, Ask enazy , Berman, Cette and Eymard (2008) iden tify a rm to b e constrained if it has failed to repa y a trade credit in the previous y ear.7The increased a v ailabilit y of ric h and comprehensiv e surv ey data on inno v ation activities at the rm lev el has enabled researc hers to adopt more direct 3approac hes to w ards the iden tication of p oten tially nancially constrained rms.8They are iden tied if they rep ort that inno v ation pro jects w ere hamp ered in some w a y b y the lac k of nance.9Ha jiv assiliou and Sa vignac (2008) emplo y suc h a direct surv ey-based measure and accoun t for sim ultaneit y of nancial constrain ts and inno v ation.
They nd that binding nancing constrain ts discourage inno v ation and at the same time inno v ativ e rms are more lik ely to face binding constrain ts.
T raditional in v estmen t mo dels as w ell as surv ey-based studies suer, ho w ev er, from difculties of distinguishing cash o w sho c ks from demand sho c ks.
Our empirical approac h is aimed at tac kling this metho dological issue.
Moreo v er, rms sim ultaneously determine their lev els of inno v ation in v estmen t, capital in v estmen t, dividends, debt pa ymen ts as w ell as reten tions.
That is, the option of in v esting in inno v ation comp etes with alternativ e uses of funds.
W e tak e this in to accoun t b y p erforming a 5-equation m ultiv ariate analysis.
Previous studies do not explicitly estimate equations for all these options, although dynamic programming mo dels of in v estmen t and nancing b eha vior do implicitly tak e alternativ e uses of funds in to accoun t.10Finally , w e explore the role of inno v ativ e capabilities for nancial constrain ts that ha v e b een generally paid little atten tion to.
3 Theo retical F ramew o rk and Hyp otheses W e dra w from a simple mo del b y Ho w e and McF etridge (1976) and Da vid, Hall and T o ole (2000) to explore ho w inno v ativ e capabilit y aects nancing constrain ts for inno v ation.11 In this setting, it is assumed that in eac h planning p erio d rm i has a certain set of ideas for inno v ation pro jects.12This set of pro jects is determined b y the rm's inno v ativ e capabilit y ( ICi ), that is, its abilit y to generate and pursue new inno v ation pro ject ideas.
The rm ranks these pro jects according to their exp ected rate of return in descending order.13This results in a do wn w ard sloping demand function ( Di ) for inno v ation nancing that reects the marginal rate of return ( MRRi ) of rmi .
The marginal rate of return dep ends on the lev el of inno v ation exp enditure ( Ii ), on the inno v ativ e capabilit y ( ICi ) as w ell as on other rm and industry c haracteristics ( Xi ): MRRi=f(Ii;ICi;Xi): (1) Prot-maximizing rm i in v ests in inno v ation up to the p oin t where the marginal rate of return equals the marginal cost of capital ( MCCi ).MCCi v aries with the size of the in v estmen t and reects the opp ortunit y costs of in v esting funds in inno v ation.
Hence, MCCi also dep ends on the exp ected returns to other uses of a v ailable funds suc h as in v estmen t in tangible or nancial assets (summarized in Re;o i ) as w ell as on the amoun t of rms' in ternal funds ( IFi ).
In imp erfect capital mark ets costs of external capital are assumed to b e higher than those of in ternal funds as lenders require a risk premium for instance due to information asymmetries.
Marginal capital costs are th us also aected b y rm c haracteristics suc h as credit w orthiness ( Wi ) whic h dep ends on collateral as w ell as capital structure.
MCCi increases with the total amoun t b orro w ed.
Finally , w e assume a 4p ec king order, i.e.
rms dra w rst on in ternal funds b efore resorting to external nancing.
MCCi=f(Ii;Re;o i;IFi;Wi): (2) Figure I illustrates b oth the demand and the marginal cost function.
Equating MRRi and MCCi yields the reduced form for optimal in v estmen t ( I i ) in inno v ation (see Grab o wski and Mueller 1972): I i=h(ICi;Re;o i;IFi;Xi;Wi): (3) What happ ens if additional cash is giv en exogenously to rms (shift from MCC to MCC0)?
Deciding up on in v estmen t, exogenous cash is not for free due to opp ortunit y costs.
If a rm can already nance its optimal in v estmen t lev el Ifully in ternally , additional cash has no eect on its inno v ation in v estmen t. A nding that the rm do es not increase its in v estmen t can either indicate that it faced the same capital costs for b oth funds b efore (as on p erfect capital mark ets) or that capital mark ets are imp erfect but the rm do es not ha v e additional b enecial inno v ation opp ortunities (at the giv en in ternal cost of capital cint ).
In an y case, suc h a rm can b e dened as nancial ly unc onstr aine d as it pursues all priv ately protable inno v ation pro jects at cint (Figure Ia).
AreaA reects priv ately non-protable inno v ation p oten tial.14If inno v ation in v estmen t is stim ulated b y exogenous cash o w sho c ks, w e can reject the h yp othesis that external and in ternal capital costs are the same.
A p ositiv e expansionary eect from additional cash on in v estmen t can th us b e seen as a result from nancing constrain ts that has curtailed rms' inno v ation in v estmen ts at sub-optimal lev els I (Figure Ib).
I0reects the inno v ation in v estmen t that is realized with additional cash.
Dep ending on the amoun t of cash, it is equal or smaller than I, the optimal in v estmen t at in ternal capital costs.
This setting allo ws us to deriv e h yp otheses ab out the in terpla y of inno v ativ e capabilit y , nancial resources and nancing constrain ts for inno v ation.
First, w e lo ok at inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Consider t w o rms A and B, B ha ving a higher inno v ativ e capabilit y than A but that are otherwise iden tical.
W e assume a rm to ha v e a higher inno v ativ e capabilit y if for eac h rate of return it has a larger or equal n um b er of pro jects at hand.
This implies that for eac h rate of return the more inno v ativ e rm demands a larger or equal additional amoun t of nancial resources.15The higher B's inno v ativ e capabilit y the more lik ely it is that additional cash leads to an expansionary eect (Figure I Ia).
If b oth rms cannot originally nance their inno v ation from in ternal funds alone, additional cash increases the inno v ation in v estmen t of b oth (Figure I Ib).
The eect, ho w ev er, is larger for the rm with higher inno v ativ e capabilit y if b oth receiv e the same amoun t CASH .
This holds as long as the slop e of DB is atter than the one of DA .
The sum of areas A+A0and B+B0represen t the rms' sto c k of pro ject ideas that render unprotable giv en the rate of b orro wing cext , resp ectiv ely .
A dditional cash reduces these costs and th us sets free additional pro jects (Areas A0andB0).
Second, Figure I I Ia sho ws ho w dieren t lev els of a v ailable in ternal nancing aect the lik eliho o d of nancing constrain ts giv en a certain inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Supp ose rms A and B ha v e the same inno v ativ e capabilit y , but dieren t lev els of in ternal funds ( IFB>IFA ).

This implies that the expansionary eect is stronger for A ev en with CASHA= CASHB .
In addition to in ternal funds, the slop e of the MCC in the non-horizon tal part lik ewise dep ends on rm prop erties that aect the rm's credit w orthiness (Wi ).
F or t w o rms with the same inno v ativ e capabilities and comparable lev els of in ternal funds, the expansionary eect is larger for rm A facing the larger gap b et w een cint andcext (Figure I I Ib).
Based on these theoretical considerations w e deriv e the follo wing h yp otheses on nancing constrain ts for inno v ation activities: Hyp othesis 1: Giv en the same lev el of in ternal funds, rms with higher inno v ativ e capabilit y should b e more lik ely to b e constrained than rms with lo w er inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Hyp othesis 2: Giv en the same lev el of inno v ativ e capabilit y , rms with lo w er nancial resources should b e more lik ely to b e constrained.

Whether the lik eliho o d of b eing constrained is larger for rms with lo w IC and lo wIF than for rms with high IC and highIF is not clear-cut.
It dep ends on whether lac k of in ternal nancing or inno v ativ e capabilit y driv es nancial constrain ts.
Ob viously , some of the assumptions of this basic setting are con testable.
This particularly concerns the non-marginal nature of pro ject costs and the information necessary to rank inno v ation opp ortunities appropriately .
F urthermore, it is assumed that rms alw a ys dra w up on in ternal funds rst.
Ho w ev er, rms ma y pa y out the additional cash to shareholders and raise external capital to lev erage the risk to lenders (Jensen and Mec kling 1976, Easterbro ok 1984, Jensen 1986).16 4 Empirical Implementation The follo wing analysis mak es use of the 2007 w a v e of the Mannheim Inno v ation P anel (MIP).
The MIP started in 1993 with the aim to pro vide represen tativ e inno v ation data for p olicy and researc h purp oses.
It is the German part of the Europ ean-wide Comm unit y Inno v ation Surv eys (CIS) and th us pro vides in ternationally comparable data.
The target p opulation co v ers all rms with at least 5 emplo y ees in the German business sector.17 The presen t study fo cuses on information of 2,468 rms in man ufacturing industries.18 The sample distribution across industries is presen ted in T able A.1 in the App endix.
4.1 Measuring Financing Constraints F ollo wing the concept of an ideal exp erimen t suggested b y Hall (2008), the surv ey requested rms to imagine that they receiv e additional funds amoun ting to 10% of the 7rms' last y ear's turno v er and to indicate ho w they w ould sp end this money .
The follo wing v e resp onse options w ere giv en of whic h they could c ho ose one or more: (additional) in v estmen t pro jects, (additional) inno v ation pro jects, reten tion / reserv es, pa y out to shareholders or repa ymen t of debt.
In this design, one can estimate the treatmen t eect b y comparing the inno v ation activities of eac h rm b efore and after the cash receipt.
In our case this is measured b y whether the rm w ould additionally in v est in inno v ation compared to the curren t situation.
A rm is th us considered to b e nancially constrained if it w ould in v est additional funds in inno v ation pro jects ( CON = 1 , otherwise CON = 0 ).
The conceptual set-up allo ws us to estimate not only the lik eliho o d of b eing constrained but also the degree to whic h these constrain ts aect the rms' inno v ation in v estmen ts.
W e distinguish three dieren t degrees: TYPE = 0=1=2 if the rm indicates that it w ould not / partially / exclusiv ely in v est in additional inno v ation pro jects.
Th us, TYPE is an ordinal v ariable that increases the more binding the rm's nancial constrain ts for innov ation are.
The v ariables CON and TYPE represen t the main dep enden t v ariables in our empirical study .
T aking in to accoun t that inno v ation comp etes with other usages, w e additionally dene a set of binary indicators for eac h of the alternativ e resp onse options and estimate a sim ultaneous m ultiv ariate probit mo del.
The approac h presen ted in this study is ob viously dieren t from traditional (R&D) inv estmen t equations (see Bond and V an Reenen 2007 for a surv ey).
A ccelerator and error-correction mo dels represen t t w o frequen tly used approac hes.
Since cash o w ma y b e correlated with future in v estmen t opp ortunities, the main critique on these reducedform in v estmen t mo dels is that estimated cash o w eects cannot b e in terpreted without am biguit y .
Excess sensitivit y tests in structural mo dels, on the other hand, are justied formally as T obin's q in the p opular Q mo del summarizes all the information ab out exp ected future protabilit y that is relev an t for the curren t in v estmen t decision.
The Q mo del, ho w ev er, requires strong assumptions, and the dissatisfaction with the empirical p erformance has led to the dev elopmen t of structural mo dels suc h as the Euler equation approac h. This approac h relaxes some of the assumptions underlying the Q mo del.
It particularly a v oids b oth parameterization of the exp ectations formation pro cess and the use of share price data.
In spite of imp ortan t theoretical adv an tages of structural in v estmen t mo dels in testing for the presence of nancial constrain ts, the empirical v alue of Euler equations has b een questioned for instance b y Bond and V an Reenen (2007).
They argue that the adv an tage of structural mo dels compared to reduced form mo dels should not b e o v erstated as the former "are based on extreme simplifying assumptions, and are frequen tly rejected when sub jected to mild empirical testing" (p. 4422).19 Our approac h attempts to address these concerns b y emplo ying a direct constrain t measure in a reduced form regression.
W e regard the reduced form as "an empirical appro ximation to some complex underlying pro cess that has generated the [surv ey] data" (see Bond and V an Reenen 2007, p. 4443).
Another dierence compared to accelerator and error-correction mo dels is that the h yp othetical exogenous cash increase is b y 8denition not driv en b y future mark et prosp ects.
Due to the direct measuremen t of nancial constrain ts, the estimation equation departs from the ones used in accelerator and error-correction mo dels.
The binary dep enden t v ariable CON represen ts an increase (or no increase) in in v estmen t instead of measuring the amount of additional in v estmen t. The ordinal dep enden t v ariable TYPE con tains a bit more information b y measuring the degree to whic h nancial constrain ts aects inno v ation, i.e.
whether rms w ould not/partially/exclusiv ely in v est the additional cash in inno v ation.
In b oth cases the results are th us not directly comparable to traditional in v estmen t mo dels.
4.2 Innovative Capabilit y and Internal Financing A ccording to our h yp otheses nancing constrain ts are a function of rm liquidit y (M Money ) and inno v ativ e capabilit y (BBrain ) .
W e distinguish b et w een 6 t yp es of rms that dier in terms of their inno v ativ e capabilit y that can b e high ( BH ) or lo w (BL ) and their nancial resources that can b e high ( MH ), medium ( MM ), or lo w (ML ).
A rm's abilit y to generate ideas for inno v ation dep ends to a large exten t on the kno wledge capital of its emplo y ees.
This can b e measured through formal qualication lev els or through kno wledge acquired b y training.
Hence, w e use information on the rm's share of highly qualied p ersonnel and its exp enditure for training of their emplo y ees.
A rm is considered to ha v e a high inno v ativ e capabilit y ( BH ) if either the share of highly qualied p ersonnel or the exp enditure on training p er emplo y ee is larger than the 80th p ercen tile (in 2006).
Other studies measure inno v ativ e capabilit y also b y the rm's R&D exp enditure or past inno v ation success.
As our study also in v olv es rms that are not (y et) engaged in R&D and inno v ation, w e prefer the more general denition ab o v e.20 The prot margin (earnings b efore taxation as a share of total sales in 2006) is used to measure the a v ailabilit y of in ternal funds.
Originally the prot margin is an ordinal v ariable with eigh t categories that w e group ed in to three dumm y v ariables (see T able A.2 in the App endix).
Firms are assumed to ha v e a lo w nancial endo wmen t (ML ) if the prot margin is smaller than zero.
If the ratio is larger than zero, but smaller than 7%, the rm exhibits a medium nancial bac kground (MM) .
Finally ,MH equals one if the rm's ratio is at least 7%.
By in teracting nancial resources and inno v ativ e capabilit y w e get 6 groups of rms that dier in their R esour c e Endowments .
T able I: Resource endo wmen tshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhInno v ativ e Capabilit yFinancial Resources highmedium low high BHMHBHMMBHML low BLMHBLMMBLML 94.3 A ccess to External Finance Being a family-o wned compan y (F AMCOM) , that is the ma jorit y of stak es b elongs to mem b ers of one family , ma y aect nancing conditions.
On the one hand, family-o wned rms ma y ha v e an adv an tage in external capital cost since they more often ha v e a close and long-established relationship with their house bank.
On the other hand, recen t empirical evidence has sho wn that family-o wned rms tend to a v oid dep endency on external lenders (P eters and W esterheide 2011).
Th us, they p erceiv e themselv es as constrained and p ostp one or cancel pro jects if these pro jects cannot b e funded b y in ternal funds.
Capital in tensit y is measured b y the v alue of rms' tangible assets p er emplo y ee in 2006 (KAPINT) and reects rms' o v erall collateral v alue.
W e further complemen ted our surv ey data with the rms' credit rating indices that w e assume to reect cost of external capital (RA TING) .
The credit rating is an index b et w een 100 and 600, 100 represen ting the b est rating.21Firms that are part of a compan y group (GR OUP) ma y b enet from in tra-group nancing o ws that represen t an alternativ e outside-rm nancing c hannel.
4.4 Control V a riables The deriv ation of our h yp otheses is based on the assumption that the rms only dier in inno v ation capacit y , in ternal funds or access to external nance.
T o tak e in to accoun t that this is not true in the data, w e include a set of con trol v ariables.
Firm age (A GE) is measured in y ears since founding, and rm size (SIZE) is measured b y the n um b er of emplo y ees.
Since the distributions of SIZE and A GE are highly sk ew ed w e tak e logs of b oth v ariables.
Moreo v er, w e include the rms' pro duct life cycle patterns (PLC) as a shorter pro duct life cycle ma y increase the pressure to dev elop new pro ducts and hence increases the need for resources.
Shorter pro duct life cycles ma y also imply shorter p erio ds for generating returns from prior pro duct inno v ations.
W e accoun t for the amoun t of additional funds that rms w ould receiv e ( CASH ) and construct v e categories for CASH on the basis of the 20, 40, 60, and 80th p ercen tile of the distribution.
W e further include a regional dumm y that indicates whether the rm is lo cated in East German y ( EAST ) to con trol for regional dierences.22T o tak e in to accoun t the comp etitiv e en vironmen t of the rm w e emplo y a Herndahl-index of industry sales concen tration published b y the German Monop olies Commission ( COMP ).
Finally , w e cannot rule out that the job function of the resp onden t ma y eect the resp onse.
W e distinguish b et w een resp onden ts from the general managemen t ( CEO ), R&D (R&D _DEP ), nancial ( FIN _DEP ), sales (SALES _DEP ), and other departmen ts ( OTHER _DEP ).
4.5 Descriptive Statistics Ab out 36% of the rms in our sample are nancially constrained as can b e gathered from the summary statistics in T able I I.
Only 5%, ho w ev er, w ould in v est the full amoun t of additional cash in inno v ation while the large ma jorit y w ould only partially in v est 10in inno v ation.
68% of the rms w ould allo cate at least part of the money to general in v estmen ts, 44% w ould pa y out the money to shareholders, 21% w ould retain the cash, and 44% w ould rather serv e debt.
When lo oking at our main co v ariates of in terest, w e see that most rms (43%) w ere classied as ha ving a rather lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y while b eing in a solid nancial situation ( BLMM ).
17% of rms with lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y are ev en in go o d nancial situation ( BLMH ).
33% of all rms w ere dened as ha ving a high inno v ativ e capabilit y .
4% of those rms ha v e a negativ e prot-turno v er-ratio (BHML ).
18% exhibit a solid nancial bac kground ( BHMM ), and 11% are nancially w ell endo w ed ( BHMH ).
The a v erage and median amoun t of CASH rms w ould receiv e is 10.12 million and 611,000 e , resp ectiv ely .
In the rst class, the mean of CASH is ab out 58,000 e , in class 2 ab out 206,600 e , in class 3 ab out 645,000 e , in class 4 ab out 2.1 million e and 47 million e in class 5.23When lo oking at the rm c haracteristics of constrained and unconstrained rms, in teresting dierences can b e inferred from the test in dierences in means.
As exp ected, constrained rms are less capital-in tensiv e, face shorter pro duct life cycles, and are less frequen tly lo cated in East German y .
A t rst glance it is surprising that they are larger, do not dier in terms of age, and ha v e a b etter credit rating.
Moreo v er, w e observ e that in the group of constrained rms, the share of rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y is higher.
This is v alid irresp ectiv e of their nancial bac kground.24 11T able I I: Summary Statistics V ariable V ar.

125 Econometric Analysis 5.1 Probit and Ordered Probit Mo dels As sho wn in section 3, the degree of nancing constrain ts ydep ends on nancial resources M , inno v ativ e capabilit y B , other observ able rms c haracteristics Z as w ell as nonobserv able factors " (for simplicit y , w e suppress rm subscripts i ): y=0+1BHML+2BHMM+3BHMH+4BLML+5BLMM+X llZl+": (4) Z includes the v ariables dened in sections 4.3 and 4.4 and a set of 14 industry dummies.
Since w e do not directly observ e the degree of constrain t, w e rst estimate the lik eliho o d of b eing nancially constrained b y using a probit mo del.
This can b e written as P(CON = 1j x) =I(y>0) = ( x); (5) with the ro w v ector x comprising the in teraction terms and Z .
A ccording to Hyp othesis 1 (H1) form ulated in section 3, w e exp ect that 1> 4 ,2> 5 , and3>0 .
F urthermore, w e exp ect for rms exhibiting the same inno v ativ e capabilit y , lik e BH , that1> 2> 3 (H2).
Finally , Hyp othesis 3 (H3) suggests a p ositiv e co ecien t of the v ariable capturing credit w orthiness as RA TING ranges from 1 to 6 with 6 b eing the w orst rating.
Con trarily , capital in tensit y and group mem b ership should negativ ely impact the lik eliho o d of b eing constrained.
In order to accoun t for heterogeneit y and correlation among rms, estimated standard errors are heteroscedasticit y-consisten t and clustered b y industries and region.
In a second step, w e pro xy the degree of constrain ts b y our categorial v ariable (TYPE) and estimate ordered probit mo dels.
T able I I I pro vides the estimation results of 3 dieren t sp ecications of the probit mo del on the lik eliho o d of facing nancial constrain ts.
Mo del 1 presen ts the base sp ecication including v ariables for inno v ativ e capabilit y and in ternal nance as w ell as con trol v ariables.
In Mo del 2 w e add v ariables reecting access to external nance ( FAMCOM , GROUP ,KAPINT andRATING ).
W e enhance the sp ecication b y including classes forCASH in mo del 3 (the lo w est category serv es as the reference category).
The marginal eects of the in teraction terms for rms with a high inno v ativ e capabilit y (BHML ,BHMM ,BHMH ) are all signican tly p ositiv e, unlik e for rms with lo w innov ativ e capabilit y ( BLML andBLMM , withBLMH b eing the reference category).
W e test the three inequalit y relations con tained in H1 individually as w ell using a join t test.
The results clearly conrm H1: Giv en the same lev el of in ternal funds, rms with a high inno v ativ e capabilit y are more lik ely to b e constrained than rms with lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Among rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y , those ha ving lo w nancial resources ( BHML ) are more lik ely to b e constrained than rms that ha v e a solid nancial bac kground (BHMM ).
T ests conrm that the marginal eect is indeed signican tly larger for rms withBHML .
Ho w ev er, Hyp othesis 2 is only partly conrmed.
W e do not observ e a monotonic relationship as w e w ould ha v e exp ected.
That is, there is no signican t dierence 13b et w een rms with BHMM andBHMH .
F urthermore it turns out that rms with lo w nancial resources and lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y ( BLML ) are not more lik ely to b e constrained than rms ha ving a ric h nancial endo wmen t and lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y .
In addition, it w as not clear from the theory whether BLML is more or less constrained than BHMH .
The empirical evidence con vincingly sho ws that rms b elonging to BHMH ha v e a higher lik eliho o d of facing constrain ts.
Altogether, these results imply that inno v ativ e capabilit y and not solely nancial resources driv es nancing constrain ts for inno v ation.
A ccoun ting for access to external nance, surprisingly w e do not nd an y robust impact ofRATING across sp ecications.
The m ultiv ariate probit mo del will shed some ligh t on this v ariable in the rm's decision-making pro cess.
The v ariables KAPINT and GROUP sho w the exp ected signs.
A higher capital in tensit y signican tly reduces the lik eliho o d of facing binding constrain ts.
Being part of a group also exerts a negativ e, y et insignican t, eect.
F amily-o wned rms seem to b e more willing to sp end this additional cash on inno v ation than non-family-o wned rms.
These four v ariables are join tly significan t and th us conrm H3.
With resp ect to the con trol v ariables no eects w ere found for the duration of the pro duct life cycle and rms' age.25Finally , w e detect dierences in resp onse patterns of the nancial departmen t and sales-managers from those of CEOs and R&D managers.
As the rms receiv e dieren t amoun t of h yp othetical cash, w e include the cash classes in sp ecication 3.
The results sho w that the p ositiv e eect of CASH is increasing with the size of the h yp othetical pa ymen t. The eect doubles from class 3 to class 4 indicating a critical size of the pa ymen t of ab out roughly 1 million e that signican tly increases the lik eliho o d of new inno v ation pro jects.
Ideally , w e w ould lik e to disen tangle size from cash eects.
Ho w ev er, CASH is measured as p ercen tage of turno v er and turno v er correlates with rm size.
Th us, w e ha v e to admit that w e cannot in terpret the eects from CASH as pure cash-eects and are furthermore faced with high m ulticollinearit y .
Therefore, w e lea v e out CASH in the subsequen t mo dels.
Finally it should b e noted that w e test for normalit y (V erb eek 2000, p.168).
The test statistics sho w that normalit y cannot b e rejected in an y of our mo dels (e.g.
p-v alue = 0.473 in Mo del 2 of T able I I I).
T able IV sho ws the results of the ordered probit mo del.
The rst and second column presen t the co ecien ts and standard errors of the mo del and columns three to eigh t sho w the marginal eects and standard errors of the lik eliho o d of the dieren t outcomes of TYPE .
The ordered mo del b y and large conrms our previous results.26Regarding the degree of constrain ts, rms with a high inno v ativ e capabilit y but lo w nancial resources exhibit a lik eliho o d of b eing constrained in terms of outcome 1 that is 18 p ercen tage p oin ts higher than for the reference group.
F or outcome 2 the eect of 3 p ercen tage p oin ts forBHML ma y app ear small.
Ho w ev er, giv en that only 5% of the rms in the sample w ould in v est the full amoun t the eect is comparativ ely large.

175.2 Multiva riate Probit Mo del Certainly , rms ha v e to c ho ose b et w een alternativ es of use for the money .
The decision for eac h of the alternativ es migh t b e inuenced b y common unobserv able factors suc h as rm-sp ecic in terest rates or the risk attitude of managers.
Estimating a single probit equation whether to additionally in v est in inno v ation then pro vides consisten t estimates but a sim ultaneous estimation that tak es in to accoun t the full co v ariance structure is in general more ecien t. T o accoun t for the riv alry in the usage of additional cash, w e therefore additionally estimate a 5-equation m ultiv ariate probit mo del: y m= xmm+"m; m = 1;:::; 5: (6) ym=I(y m>0); m = 1;:::; 5: = ("1;:::;" 5)0N(0;) m represen ts the decisions to in v est in ph ysical capital, in inno v ation, to build reserv es, to pa y out to shareholder or to repa y debts.
The v ariance-co v ariance matrix  has v alues of 1 on the diagonal due to normalization and correlations jk=kj as o-diagonal elemen ts.
The log-lik eliho o d function is then giv en b y: lnL(1;:::; 5;;yj x) =NX i=1ln5((qi1 xi11;:::;qi5 xi55) ; ); (7) whereqim= 2yim1 .
The matrix has v alues of 1 on the diagonal and !jk=!kj= qijqikjk forj6=k andj;k= 1;:::; 5 as o-diagonal elemen ts.
5 denotes the join t normal distribution of order 5.
The expression for lnL th us in v olv es a 5-dimensional in tegral that do es not ha v e a closed form.
It can b e ev aluated n umerically through sim ulation.
W e emplo y the Maxim um Sim ulated Lik eliho o d Metho d using the GHK sim ulator (Gew ek e 1989, Ha jiv assiliou and McF adden 1998, and Keane 1994), for a detailed description of sim ulation metho ds w e also refer to T rain (2009).
W e use the user-written command cmp in Stata to estimate the m ultiv ariate probit mo del (see Ro o dman 2009).27The MSL estimator is consisten t if the n um b er of dra ws R rises withN .
It is also ecien t if R rises faster thanp N .
F urthermore, the sim ulation bias is negligible when the ratio of the n um b er of dra ws top N is sucien tly large (Ha jiv assiliou and Ruud 1994).
W e set the n um b er of dra ws to 2p N .
The sim ulation metho d requires to dra w random v ariables from an upp er-truncated normal distribution.
W e emplo y dra ws based on Halton sequences as they are more eectiv e for sim ulated MSL estimation than pseudo-random dra ws (T rain 2009).
T able V presen ts the results from the m ulti-equation probit mo del and T able A.3 in the App endix depicts the estimated correlation co ecien ts.
The table rev eals signican t correlations b et w een most of the error terms indicating that the equations should indeed b e estimated sim ultaneously .
W e enric h the sp ecication b y including rms' legal form ( PUBLIC and LIMITED , PIV A TE serv es as the reference category) as it ma y aect pa y outs to shareholders, for example.
The ndings for in v esting in additional inno v ation pro jects remain nearly unc hanged.
In terestingly , our main v ariables of in terest sho w a fundamen tally dieren t pattern in the decision to in v est in ph ysical capital.
Ha ving a lo w 18inno v ativ e capabilit y leads to a higher lik eliho o d of c ho osing additional in v estmen ts, the eect b eing highest for BLML .
Firms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y and lo w nancial resources ha v e a lo w er lik eliho o d of using the additional money for building reserv es than other rms.
The t yp e of rms that w ere most lik ely to in v est the additional cash in inno v ation turn out least lik ely to build reserv es or to pa y out cash.
The results from equation 4 illustrate that all rms are less lik ely to distribute the cash to their shareholders than the reference group of rms that ha v e a lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y and ric h nancial resources.
Unlik e the c hoice for inno v ation, the decision to serv e debt is to a large exten t driv en b y the nancial bac kground.
F or b oth, high and lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y , the lik eliho o d of serving debt rises with decreasing liquidit y .
That is, w e observ e the largest eects forBLML andBHML .
This is in line with the results found for RATING .
Firms with a w orse RATING ha v e a higher probabilit y of serving debt.
These rms seems to giv e priorit y to consolidating their nancial reputation b efore in v esting in new pro jects.
In terestingly , the nancial departmen t turns out to b e more willing to pa y out the cash or to pa y bac k debt than CEOs.
Moreo v er, esp ecially public but also limited rms are more lik ely to distribute cash to their shareholders while b eing less lik ely to reduce debt.
Estimates for rms b elonging to a group suggest that they are generally less constrained: They are less lik ely to pursue additional in v estmen t pro jects and ha v e a lo w er prop ensit y to pa y bac k debts.

205.3 Robustness Checks The previous sections p oin ted out the imp ortan t role of inno v ativ e capabilit y for nancing constrain ts.
A dmittedly , w e cannot observ e inno v ativ e capabilit y directly .
T o test the robustness of our results, w e emplo y alternativ e pro xies for inno v ativ e capabilit y .
First, w e measure inno v ativ e capabilit y b y the same v ariables but use dieren t cut-o-p oin ts (mean, median and 90th p ercen tile of b oth highly qualied p ersonnel and exp enses for training of emplo y ees) or measure it relativ e to the resp ectiv e industry distribution.
The results are robust within a broad range of cut-o-denitions, as can b e gathered from T able A.4 in the App endix.
Second, w e emplo y three alternativ e v ariables to dene inno v ativ e capabilit y .
W e b egin with using only the share of highly qualied p ersonnel (not accoun ting for training).
Next, w e test a stricter denition of inno v ation-related h uman capital b y using the share of R&D emplo y ees.
F or these t w o c hec ks the original 80% cut-o-p oin t is applied.
Finally , w e dene inno v ativ e capabilit y based on successful inno v ation pro jects in the past.
More precisely , w e observ e if the rm has in tro duced at least one new pro duct to the mark et in the pre-surv ey p erio d. T able VI summarizes the results from this exercise for our main v ariables of in terest.
As b efore, w e also nd 1> 2 .
Ho w ev er, supp ort for 1> 3 is only giv en if w e dene inno v ativ e capabilit y based on past inno v ation success.
Another concern whic h ma y arise is that the results of the quasi-exp erimen t dep end on the fact whether a rm w as already engaged in inno v ation activities.
W e estimate a t w o-stage selection mo del for b oth CON andTYPE .
The rst stage describ es whether the rm has b een inno v ativ e in the past t w o y ears ( INNO ).28The selection mo del hinges up on at least one v alid exclusion restriction.
W e exp ect the rms' exp ort in tensit y ( EXINT ) and the div ersication of its pro duct p ortfolio ( DIVERS ) to aect the lik eliho o d to inno v ate, while it should not impact the lik eliho o d to face nancial constrain ts.
Hence, w e use b oth v ariables as exclusion restriction in the rst stage.29F rom T able VI I w e see that DIVERS andEXINT are signican t in Stage 1.
F urthermore, SIZE ,GROUP , and seller concen tration ( COMP ) stim ulates inno v ation, whereas the eect of AGE is negativ e. Ho w ev er, the lik eliho o d-ratio-test do es not reject the h yp othesis of indep endence of stage 1 and 2.
Th us, selectivit y do es not seem to pla y a role here.
Consequen tly , the results do not c hange considerably compared to the mo dels presen ted in section 5.1.

6 Conclusions Financing conditions for inno v ation activities in imp erfect capital mark ets ma y b e one reason for w elfare reducing under-in v estmen t in kno wledge capital.
Firms with limited in ternal funds ma y ha v e to lea v e some of their inno v ation pro jects on the shelf due to restricted access to external nancing.
Suc h pro jects w ould b e protable at the in ternal rate of return but are not rew arding giv en the 'risk-premium' on the cost of external capital.
This article con tributes to the literature on nancing constrain ts for inno v ation in three main asp ects.
First, a new approac h of measuring nancial constrain ts allo ws us to estimate the lik eliho o d of b eing constrained as w ell as the degree based on a direct indicator deriv ed from a test closer to the 'ideal test' as suggested b y Hall (2008).
By using m ultiv ariate probit mo dels, w e secondly tak e in to accoun t that the decision to engage in 25inno v ation pro jects is part of the rms' o v erall optimization pro cess.
Third, w e deriv e a framew ork that attributes nancing constrain ts not only to the lac k of nancial resources but also to the rms' inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Our econometric analysis supp orts the h yp othesis that nancial constrain ts hold bac k inno v ation activities.
W e nd rms with higher inno v ativ e capabilit y to b e more lik ely to ha v e unexploited inno v ation pro jects, indep enden t of their nancial bac kground (Hyp othesis 1).
Our results further sho w that rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y and lo w lev els of in ternal funds are more lik ely to b e constrained than their more liquid coun terparts (Hyp othesis 2).
In summary , rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y but lo w nancial resources turn out most lik ely to b e constrained.
Is this result surprising as inno v ation capabilities are necessary to do inno v ation?
It could b e argued that rms with high capabilities are able to attract funds easier b ecause of the higher exp ected success of their pro jects.
This study , ho w ev er, suggests the opp osite.
In v estors - although they migh t b e a w are of the fact that skills are an imp ortan t success factor of R&D - do not sucien tly v alue suc h skills.
Uncertain t y ab out the outcome of inno v ation pro jects seems to out w eigh information on skills.
Firms in v esting in in tangible assets suc h as h uman capital instead of ph ysical capital ma y ev en exp erience an additional disadv an tage in raising funds due to lo w er 'relativ e collateral v alue'.
Hence, nancial constrain ts do not dep end on the a v ailabilit y of in ternal funds p er se, but are driv en b y inno v ativ e capabilit y .
W e further nd that lo w capital in tensit y has a signican t eect on the lik eliho o d and degree of b eing constrained (Hyp othesis 3).
On the other hand, our main v ariables of in terest pla y a fundamen tally dieren t role in the decision to in v est in ph ysical capital.
Here, a lo w inno v ativ e capabilit y leads to a higher lik eliho o d of c ho osing additional capital in v estmen ts.
The m ultidimensional analysis further rev eals that in con trast to the inno v ation c hoice, the decision to serv e debt is to a large exten t driv en b y the nancial bac kground.
Consequen tly , rms with lo w in ternal funds or bad credit ratings w ould primarily repa y debt instead of in v esting additional cash in new inno v ation pro jects.
Another notable result of our study is that family-o wned businesses are more lik ely to in v est additional cash in inno v ation pro jects than rms with other o wnership structures.
This ma y , ho w ev er, indicate that these rms ha v e a general preference for in ternal nancing.
In particular, w e exp ect that family-run businesses w ould answ er dieren tly if loans at a comparativ ely lo w in terest rate w ould ha v e b een oered instead of cash.
F uture researc h will b e directed to ho w m uc h the results dep end on the fact that the question oers cash only .
F rom a p olicy p oin t of view, w e conclude that a signican t p ortion of rms is nancially constrained, particularly rms with high inno v ativ e capabilit y .
Hence, p olicy should stim ulate the pro vision of risk-taking external capital and pro vide public funding.
If inno v ativ e capabilit y is the driving force b ehind nancing constrain ts, this should b e regarded as an imp ortan t criterion for supp orting priv ate in v estmen t in inno v ation.
Either 26pro ject selection or gran ting tax credits could accoun t for suc h factors as they reect the rms' abilit y to release unexploited inno v ation p oten tial and turn ideas in to inno v ativ e pro ducts or pro cesses.

Recen tly , Bro wn and P etersen (2009) and Bro wn, F azzari and P etersen (2009) observ e a signican t increase in the share of new sto c k issues in the nancial structure of y oung U.S. man ufacturing rms and attribute this to impro v emen ts in equit y mark ets.
In a comparable analysis, Martinsson (2010) nd a similar shift in in- and external equit y for y oung high-tec h rms in the UK, but not in Con tinen tal Europ e. The latter app eared to ha v e exp erienced a supply shift in cash o w only .
5See for example Sc hian tarelli (1996), Hubbard (1998), Bond and V an Reenen (2007) for surv eys of the literature.
6That is, rms are group ed in to supp osedly more and less constrained rms.
The latter are exp ected to b e able to raise funds for an y in v estmen t. Hence, in v estmen t sp ending should not turn out to b e sensitiv e to the a v ailabilit y of in ternal funds.
In con trast, the former group of p oten tially constrained rms is exp ected to sho w a p ositiv e relationship that rev eals the existence of liquidit y constrain ts.
7Using F renc h rm-lev el data, they sho w that the share of R&D in v estmen t o v er total in v estmen t is coun ter-cyclical without credit constrain ts, but is less coun ter-cyclical as rms face tigh ter credit constrain ts.
8Inno v ation surv eys are collected in most OECD coun tries.
In Europ e they are called the Comm unit y Inno v ation Surv eys (CIS).
The surv ey metho dology is based on guidelines set out b y the Oslo Man ual (OECD and Eurostat 2005, rst published in 1992).

10Dynamic programming mo dels determine optimal in v estmen t and nancing decisions b y maximizing rm v alue (see Auerbac h 1979, F azzari et al.
1988, and Hall 1995 for an extension to R&D).
Grab o wski and Mueller (1972) and Gugler (2003) sim ultaneously in v estigate the determinan ts of R&D, capital in v estmen t and dividends.
Guerard, Bean and Andrews (1987) additionally accoun t for new debt issue.
11This supply and demand heuristic has also b een used b y Hubbard (1998) for inv estmen ts and b y F azzari et al.
(1988) and Carp en ter and P etersen (2002) to illustrate nancing hierarc hies for R&D.
12F or simplicit y , the pro jects are assumed to b e nely divisible so that the resulting marginal rate of return (MRR) sc hedule is con tin uous and con tin uously dieren tiable.
13The exp ected rate of return is deriv ed from the exp ected b enets less implemen tation costs.
14These pro jects ma y generate additional so cial returns that migh t render them profitable from a w elfare p oin t of view.
15This assumption assures that i) the t w o demand curv es either ha v e the same in tercept or the one of the more inno v ativ e rm starts at a higher p oin t, and ii) the demand curv e of the more inno v ativ e rm exhibits a atter slop e. 16An ev en "more ideal" test for the degree of nancial constrain ts w ould b e to ask: what w ould b e the amoun t a rm w ould in v est if capital mark ets w ere p erfect?
If w e assume 31that the marginal costs of capital in case of p erfect capital mark ets are the same as the in ternal marginal costs of capital in imp erfect mark ets and the amoun t of additional cash is large enough (exploiting the inno v ation p oten tial) then the outcome w ould b e the same as ab o v e. If the additional cash is not large enough to undertak e all b enecial pro jects, rms w ould still b e constrained.
In that case w e w ould underestimate the expansionary eect.
But since w e only ask w ether they w ould sp end additional cash on the dieren t sources and not ho w m uc h, our eect go es in the same direction as this more ideal test w ould go.

21The credit rating index is a standardized measure pro vided b y Creditreform, German y's largest credit rating agency .
22Due to extensiv e R&D subsidy programs targeting East German rms, these rms w ere found to face less nancing constrain ts in the 1990s and early 2000s (Czarnitzki 2006).
23The maxim um h yp othetical pa ymen t of 4.4 billion e is no data error but refers to a large compan y in the energy sector.

25W e tested dieren t forms of AGE , suc h as non-logged or age classes.
F urther, w e tried non-linear sp ecications.
AGE did not turn out to b e signican t in an y of these alternativ e sp ecications.
Ho w ev er, the surv ey is represen tativ e for rms with at least 5 emplo y ees.
This implies that a large prop ortion of v ery y oung rms do es not b elong to the target p opulation.

27Cmp stands for conditional mixed pro cess.
It is a v ery general command encompassing a broad range of limited dep enden t v ariable mo dels, and it allo ws mixing of these mo dels in m ulti-equation systems.
It diers in a few tec hnical asp ects from the userwritten command m vprobit in Stata, for more details see Ro o dman (2009).
One virtue of the command is the straigh tforw ard calculation of marginal eects.
28INNO equals one if the rm either had a pro duct or pro cess inno v ation, or has ongoing or abandoned inno v ation activities in the p erio d 2004-2006, zero else.
