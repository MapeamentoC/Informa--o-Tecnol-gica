U.S. d airy exports to Southeast Asia1 have been weak to start 2023.
Resilient global milk production, currently on a 10 -month streak of annual gains on a monthly basis dating back to last July , has put downward pressure on prices of manufactured dairy commodities .
Through May, exports of dairy products on a value basis to Southeast Asia h ave totaled $561 million, down 33 percent from the same period last year.
There have been broad declines across multiple commodities, including skimmed milk powder, whey and cheese.
This is coming in a period where SMP prices are down 37 percent and whey p rices are 52 percent from the peak in February 2022.
As the world enters a post -COVID lockdown world, governments are now under pressure to reign in fiscal spending and combat high food inflation, which have reached an all -time in high in many countries in the region , typically done via higher interest rates.
In the Philippines, food inflation reached 11 percent, driven by increases in dietary staples like vegetables .
Increasing food costs have forced consume rs to reduce discretionary spending (a category which includes spending on dairy product s which are not a major part of traditional diets) .
Lower discret ionary spending is impacting both the restaurant industry and retail purchases.
Demand for whey and lactose has also fallen in several countries.
In Vietnam, swine herds continue to recover from African swine fever , reducing demand for whey and lactose for feed use (export volumes to Vietnam for both products are down 11 and 23 percent, respectively) .
In the Philippines, another market that ha s been impacted by A SF, exports of whey and lactose have fallen 26 and 9 percent, respectively .
There also continue to be regulatory pressures in Southeast Asia hindering U.S. dairy exporters this year, specifically halal certifications processes .
The development of dairy exports on the global market has been one of the biggest success stories for U.S. agriculture over the last 2 decades.
Growth in the S outheast Asia market has been an important factor in expanding exports from $1 billion in 2003 to $9.5 billion in 2022 (dairy exports to Southeast Asia totaled $1.7 billion in 2022, the third largest regional market in the world for dairy exports behind North America and East Asia) .
U.S. dairy exporters have captured sizeable market share, but stiff competition continues from Oceania and the European Union, which benefit from long -standing trading infrastructure in the region and tariff advantages granted in free trade agreements.
The recently established Indo -Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is a potential avenue to gaining similar advantages for U.S. agriculture in the region.

•In A rgentina , milk production is forecast to decline 3 percent as severe drought has resulted in poor forage conditions and expensive, poor -quality hay.
In addition, significant peso depreciation2 continues to hover over dairy production.
In the past, strong depreciation in the peso ha s corresponded with declines in milk production because most inputs, mainly concentrates, are dollar denominated , and the ir prices are set by the open market.
Meanwhile, the price of milk , of which nearly 80 percent is destined for domestic use, can take several months to adjust to the new dollar value and compress margins in the near te rm for producers.

E xtreme Spring rains resulted in a shortage of hay suppl ies and strong beef prices in recent years continues to incentivize dairy farmers to shift to beef production, with the dairy herd size forecast to shrink 0.7 percent to 1.325 million cows .
Producers are also still grappling with labor shortages that stem from COVID -related border crossing restrictions in 2020 that reduced the number of visa approvals for holiday and backpacking travelers , a historical source of on -farm workers .
Since Australia has re -opened its borders, finding on -farm labor has become easier, but on-farm labor has not returned to pre-pandemic levels .
To make up the gap in fewer employees, dairy operations have turned to different production practices that natura lly depress milk output, including decreasing daily milkings from three to two or converting to ten milkings per week.
As a result, milk yields are forecast to fall 2.3 percent .
These factors offset otherwise favorable conditions for milk production including strong milk prices, improved water availability , and high quality, affordable domestic feed.
• European Union milk production is forecast relatively unchanged, marginally declining to 144.0 million tons .
Milk production grew during the first 5 months of the year due to year -over -year increases in productivity , despite a declin e in the milk herd of over 100,000 cows .
However, newly implemented environmental and animal welfare policies introduced in many EU member state s have contributed to herd size reduction and have stressed growth in yields that have previously helped continue to grow the milk pool .

Complying with the new regulations puts producers in a dilemma : either invest large amounts of capital to adopt new production processes or shift production to beef and increase slaughter .
Declining EU farmgate milk prices and increasing cost of production – higher feed, energy , and labor costs – have also accelerated exits from the dairy sector.
Narrowing margins have driven closures in small and medium -sized operations in Spain, France, Germany and Poland , and is expected to continue to weigh on production as the year goes on .
• In New Zealand , milk production is forecast at 21.5 million tons, up 2 percent from 2022.
Wet conditions in December and January and improved soil moisture have been greatly beneficial for summer pasture growth in key dairy regions in the North Island.
As a result, milk production in the first 5 months was 3 percent higher compared to 2022.
The outlook through September is promising as rainfall is expected to be average or above average in many key dairy regions in the North and South Island.
Warmer- than- average sea temperatures should help reduce intense cold winds in the South, which shoul d benefit milk production during the winter .
The farmgate milk price continues to be strong this year, though down from 2022.
Fonterra listed its outlook for the upcoming year at a range from NZ$7.23 to NZ$8.75 per kilogram milk solids compared to the rang e from last year at NZ$8.78 -NZ$10.25 per kilogram milk solids .
Lower prices and rising farm input costs due to inflation and higher interest rates will lead to a decrease in profitability , smaller herd sizes and reduced use of imported feed.
Some dairy farm operations will be impacted by the ban on live animal exports that went into effect on April 30 .
Live animal exports to China provided a reliable revenue stream for some dairy producers as prices ranged from NZ $1,600- NZ$2,000 USD per cow; however , the 2-year transition period granted by the government after passage of the new legislation has now expired .
Trade data indicates that 280,000 live cattle were shipped to China from April 2021 -April 2023.

• European Union cheese production is expected to rise by 1 percent despite declining milk production.
S tronger relative prices to other dairy products will see processors allocate a larger portion of the milk pool to cheese production.
Growing domestic retail demand for cheese and growth in the hospitality and tourism sectors are expected to support further ch eese production.
Exports were flat to start the year, reflecting weaker global demand for commodity cheeses , particularly in the United States and Japan.
While tighter milk supplies and higher prices, may negatively impact the competitiveness of commodity cheeses, specialty cheeses remain popular and expected to support growing exports .
Through May, shipments to the U nited Kingdom (+3 percent) are more than offset by weaker shipments to the United State s (-9 percent) and Japan ( -12 percent).
• Australia cheese exports are revised down to 120 .0 million tons , reflectin g a weak start to the year that saw exports decline 22 percent through May compared to last year.
Shipments to large export markets in East and Southeast Asia have been weak across the board.
The industry believes that buyers have shifted to purchasing on a n "asneeded basis " while global commodity prices have been high.
Shipments are expected to moderately improve in the second half of the year as economic conditions improve in some of Australia's larger markets ( especially China ) but import demand across other East and Southeast Asian markets is forecast to remain weak through the end of 2023.

• Butter production in New Zealand is forecast to increase to 530,000 tons , in part reflecting better returns for manufacturing skimmed milk powder (SMP) shift ing larger allocations of the milk pool to butter and SMP .
Exports are forecast to increase 5 percent , reflecting price competitiveness against major exporters of butter, notably the European Union .
Through May, exports are u p 11 percent over year -ago levels, with strong growth to Mexico (more than doubled ), Australia (+80 percent) , Saudi Arabia (+49 percent) , and the United States (more than tripled ).
Growth in these markets more than offsets weaker shipments to China ( -4 percent) .
• Butter import s by China are forecast to reach 135,000 tons , a decline from last year as sustained high import prices weigh on demand from bakeries, the food processing sector, and retail consumers.
Despite heavy investment in dairy production in country, imports account for 55 percent of butter consumption.

• Australia exports of SMP are forecast to decline 16 percent due to the combination of lower production and lower beginning stocks.
Exports through May have slowed significantly compared to the same period in 2022.
During January -May , overall exports fell by 21,000 tons (29 percent) , led by slower shipments to Indonesia ( down 8,500 MT or -53 percent), Vietnam ( down 5,000 MT or - 89 percent) and Malaysia ( down 3,200 MT or -86 percent) .
Shipments to China have been strong this year, up 4,500 tons (+15 percent), and continue to account for half of Australia SMP exports as Chinese import demand for SMP has grown in response to lower global SMP prices.
• European Union SMP production is forecast down 1 percent from 2022 reflecting tighter milk supplies .
However, global demand for EU SMP has been strong through May, as attractive prices have supported EU competitiveness on the global market .
Shipments have grown in each o f the top seven markets, primarily in Africa, Middle East , and Southeast Asia.
Exports to the two largest markets historically, China and Algeria, have more than doubled.

Contributing to the lower SMP export forecast is slow exports to Southeast Asia, which has been an important market for growing SMP exports, as food inflation and regulatory issues in those countries impact demand for dairy products.
Through May, exports have been 2 percent below 2022 in the same period, with shipments to the Philippines (-43 percent) , Indonesia (-16 percent) , Vietnam (- 41 percent) , Malaysia (- 52 percent) and China (-39 percent ) all significantly off last year's pace.
Growth in exports to Mexico (+43 percent ), the largest export market for U.S. SMP exports, offsets the decline in Asian demand, as improving economic cond itions drive consumer discretionary spending and higher processor demand for raw materials for processed dairy products .

• New Zealand WMP production is forecast at 1.45 million tons in 2023, a 4-percent increase from 2022 , but still below the five-year average .
Higher returns for whey, protein concentrates and SMP have seen processors shift milk production away from WMP.
That said, WMP production still accounts for more than half of all milk processed for factory use on a milk -equivalent basis and remains the top exported dairy product on a value basis.
Through May, e xports are 7 percent higher than 2022 with strong demand from Algeria (shipments have more than doubl ed) and the U nited Arab Emirates (+33 percent) .
Continued demand from these markets will support year -overyear gains while exports to China and Indonesia moderate .
• WMP production in China is forecast to increase to nearly 1.
2 million tons due to strong growth in domestic milk production .
Milk supplies have outpaced processing demand, prompting local governments in major dairy production regions to allocate funds to subsidize whole milk powder production.
Given small capacity for butter and cheese production and high domestic demand for milk powders due to longer shelf life , dairy Foreign Agricultural Service/USDA 8 July 2023 Global Market Analysiscompanies generally purchase raw milk and process it into milk powder for storage in accordance with the "Fresh Milk Purchase and Sales Contract."
Risin g domestic WMP production, combined with continued high import prices, has driven a significant decline (-34 percent) in imports of WMP year -over -year, exacerbated by the General Administration of Customs of the Peoples Republic of China announcing that N ew Zealand, traditionally the dominant supplier of WMP, was poised t o exhaust its preferential quota for 2023 and that safeguard measures would be implemented as built into the free trade agreement between both nations .
Imports from New Zealand are down 45 percent through June .
