EXECUTIVE SUMMARYAccountability: the obligation to report, or give account of, one's actions – for example, to a governing authoritythrough scrutiny, contract, management, regulation and/or to an electorate.Care coordination: a proactive approach in bringing care professionals and providers together around the needs ofservice users to ensure that people receive integrated and person-focused care across various settings.
Case management: a targeted, community-based and proactive approach to care that involves case-finding,assessment, care planning and care coordination to integrate services around the needs of people with long-termconditions.Community health worker: people who provide health and medical care to members of their local community,often in partnership with health professionals.
Alternatively known as a: village health worker; community healthaide/promoter; lay health advisor; expert patient; and/or community volunteer.Continuity of care:the degree to which a series of discrete health care events is experienced by people as coherentand interconnected over time, and consistent with their health needs and preferences.Continuous care: care that is provided to people over time across their life course.Co-production of health: care that is delivered in an equal and reciprocal relationship between professionals,people using care services, their families and the communities to which they belong.
Co-production implies a long-term relationship between people, providers and health systems where information, decision-making and servicedelivery become shared.E-health: information and communication technologies that support the remote management of people andcommunities with a range of health care needs through supporting self-care and enabling electroniccommunications between health care professionals and patients.Empowerment: the process of supporting people and communities to take control of their own health needsresulting, for example, in the uptake of healthier behaviours or the ability to self-manage illnesses.Engagement:involving people and communities in the design, planning and delivery of health services that, forexample, enable them to make choices about care and treatment options or to participate in strategic decision-making on how health resources be spent.High quality care:care that is safe, effective, people-centred, timely, efficient, equitable and integrated.
Integrated health services:the management and delivery of health services such that people receive a continuumof health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, disease-management, rehabilitation and palliativecare services, through the different levels and sites of care within the health system, and according to their needsthroughout the life course.Intersectoral action:the inclusion of several sectors, in addition to health, when designing and implementingpublic policies that seek to improve health care and quality of life.Glossary of key termsDraft for consultation 5PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESMutual accountability:the process by which two (or multiple) partners agree to be held responsible for thecommitments that they have made to each other.People-centred care:an approach to care that consciously adopts individuals', carers', families' and communities'perspectives as participants in, and beneficiaries of, trusted health systems that respond to their needs andpreferences in humane and holistic ways.
People-centred care also requires that people have the education andsupport they need to make decisions and participate in their own care.
It is organized around the health needs andexpectations of people rather than diseases.Person-centred care:care approaches and practices that see the person as a whole with many levels of needs andgoals, with these needs coming from their own personal social determinants of health.Population health:an approach to health care that seeks to improve the health outcomes of a group ofindividuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.Primary care:first-contact, accessible, continued, comprehensive and coordinated care to people and communities.Primary health care:refers to the concept elaborated in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata, which is based on theprinciples of equity, participation, intersectoral action, appropriate technology and a central role played by thehealth system.Draft for consultation 7PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESWHO global strategy on integrated people-centred health services: an overview Draft for consultation 9PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESThe World Health Organization (WHO) global strategy on integrated people-centred health services (IPCHS)is a call for a fundamental paradigm shift in the way health services are funded, managed and delivered.
Thesechanges are urgently needed to meet the challenges being faced by health systems around the world.
Despitesignificant advances in people's health and life expectancy, relative improvements have been deeply unequalboth between countries and within them.
Still more than 1 billion of the world's citizens remain without anyaccess to health care whilst satisfaction with health services remains low in many countries.
The nature ofhealth care problems, which were once focused on the management of infectious diseases, has shifted.Health is increasingly shaped by ageing populations, urbanization and the globalization of unhealthylifestyles, resulting in a transition in the burden of health care towards noncommunicable diseases, mentalhealth and injuries.
Many of these conditions are chronic, requiring long-term care, with patients commonlysuffering from multi-morbidities, all of which adds to escalating health care costs.The fragmented nature of today's health systems means that they are becoming increasingly unable torespond to the demands placed upon them.
For example, fragile and poorly integrated health systems werekey contributors to the Ebola crisis in West Africa and continued lack of connection between health systemsand strengthening capacities within the International Health Regulations leaves other countries vulnerable.Poorer countries still face significant problems of unequal geographical access to health services, shortagesof health workers and weak supply chains.
The focus on hospital-based, disease-based and self-contained"silo" curative care models undermines the ability of health systems to provide universal, equitable, high-quality and financially sustainable care.
Service providers are often unaccountable to the populations theyserve and therefore have limited incentive to provide the responsive care that matches the needs andpreferences of their users.
People are often unable to make appropriate decisions about their own health andhealth care, or exercise control over decisions about their health and that of their communities.Universal health coverage (UHC) will not be achieved without improvements in service delivery so that allpeople are able to access high quality health services that meet their needs and preferences.
This strategycalls for reforms to reorient health services, shifting away from fragmented supply-oriented models, towardshealth services that put people and communities at their centre, and surrounds them with responsive servicesthat are coordinated both within and beyond the health sector, irrespectively of country setting anddevelopment status.IntroductionDraft for consultation 10 WHO GLOBAL STRATEGY ON INTEGRATED PEOPLE-CENTRED HEALTH SERVICES 2016-2026.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYDeveloping more integrated people-centred care systems has the potential to generate significant benefits tothe health and health care of all people, including improved access to care, improved health and clinicaloutcomes, better health literacy and self-care, increased satisfaction with care, improved job satisfaction,improved efficiency of services, and reduced overall costs.The strategy sets forth a compelling vision of "a future in which all people have access to health services thatare provided in a way that responds to their life course needs and preferences, are coordinated across thecontinuum of care and are safe, effective, timely, efficient and of acceptable quality".
The strategy is basedon experience gained in different countries over the last few years, as well as on wide-ranging consultationwith experts at the global, regional and national level, informed by a number of related global policycommitments, regional strategies and initiatives in the area of UHC, primary health care, health systemsstrengthening and social determinants of health.
For the development of this strategy, four different types of country settings have been analysed: low,middle and high income countries, as well as countries facing special circumstances such as conflict-affectedand fragile states, small island states and large federal states.
Recognizing that health systems are highlycontext specific, this strategy does not propose a single model of people-centred and integrated healthservices.
Instead, it proposes five interdependent strategic goals that need to be adopted in order for healthservice delivery to become more integrated and people-centred.Strategic goals, objectives, policy-options and interventionsTo meet the fundamental challenges faced by today's health systems, this strategy proposes the followingfive interdependent strategic goals:1.
Empowering and engaging people2.
Strengthening governance and accountability3.
Reorienting the model of care4.
Creating an enabling environment Country setting& development status Universal, equitable, people-centred & integrated health servicesCommunityFamily PERSON Healthsector:governance,financing &resources Othersectors:education,sanitation,social assistance,labour, housing,environment& others Servicedelivery:networks,facilities &practitionersFigure.
Conceptual framework for integrated people-centred health servicesDraft for consultation 11PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESAction on each of these strategic goals is intended to have an influence at different levels – from the wayservices are delivered to individuals, families and communities, to changes in the way organizations, caresystems and policy-making operate.
Several strategic objectives, as well as potential policy options andinterventions are described further below for the attainment of each strategic goal.
Some of these potentialpolicy options and interventions are cross-cutting for several strategic objectives.
This non-exhaustivereference list has been drafted on the basis of literature reviews, input from technical consultation meetingsand expert opinion and does not constitute a set of evidence-based guidelines for reform as evidence onmany of these policies and interventions is still weak.
Moreover, the appropriate mix of policies andinterventions to be used at the country level will need to be designed and developed taking into account thelocal context, values and preferences.
Empowering and engaging people is about providing the opportunity, skills and resources that people needto be articulate and empowered users of health services.
It is also about reaching the underserved andmarginalized groups of the population in order to guarantee universal access to services.
This goal seeks tounlock community and individual resources for action at all levels.
It aims at empowering individuals to makeeffective decisions about their own health and at enabling communities to become actively engaged in co-producing healthy environments, providing care services in partnership with the health sector and othersectors, and contributing to healthy public policy.
1.1 Empowering and engaging individuals and families:individuals and families need to be harnessed toachieve better clinical outcomes through co-production of care, particularly for noncommunicable andchronic diseases.
This is fundamental because people themselves will spend the most time living with andresponding to their own health needs and will be the ones making choices regarding healthy behaviours andtheir ability to self-care or care for their dependents.
Empowerment is also about care that is delivered in anequal and reciprocal relationship between clinical and non-clinical professionals and the individuals using careservices, their families, and communities, improving their care experience.Policy options and interventions:ñ Health educationñ Shared clinical decision making between individual, families and providersñ Self-management including personal care assessment and treatment plansñ Patient satisfaction surveys1.2 Empowering and engaging communities:enables communities to voice their needs and so influencethe way in which care is funded, planned and provided.
It helps build confidence, trust, mutual respect and thebuilding of social networks, because people's physical and mental well-being depends on strong and enduringrelationships.
It strengthens the capacity of communities to organize themselves and generate changes intheir living environments.Policy options and interventions:ñ Community delivered care and community health workersñ Development of civil society, user and patient groupsñ Peer support and expert patient groupsStrategic Goal 1: Empowering and engaging peopleDraft for consultation 12 WHO GLOBAL STRATEGY ON INTEGRATED PEOPLE-CENTRED HEALTH SERVICES 2016-2026.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1.3 Reaching the underserved & marginalized:is of paramount importance in order to guarantee universalaccess to health services.
It is essential for fulfilling broader societal goals such as equity, social justice andsolidarity, and helps social cohesion.
It requires actions at all levels of the health sector, as well as concertedaction with other sectors and all segments of society, in order to address the other determinants of healthand health equity.Policy options and interventions:ñ Health equity goals integrated into health sector objectivesñ Outreach services for the underserved including mobile units, transport systems and telemedicineñ Contracting out services when warrantedñ Expanding primary care-based systemsStrategic Goal 2: Strengthening governance and accountabilityStrengthening governance and accountability involves improving policy dialogue as well as policyformulation and evaluation together with citizens, communities and other stakeholders.
It is aboutpromoting transparency in decision-making and generating robust systems for the collective accountabilityof policy-makers, managers, providers and users through aligning governance, accountability and incentives.2.1 Bolstering participatory governance:robust governance mechanisms are required to achieve acoherent and integrated approach in health care policy and planning.
This is needed to ensure that thedifferent goals of donor agencies and vertical programmes tackling specific diseases do not hinder the abilityof health systems to focus on community health and well-being for all.
Governments need to takeresponsibility for protecting and enhancing the welfare of their populations and build trust and legitimacywith citizens through effective stewardship.
The stewardship role is the essence of good governance andinvolves the identification and participation of community stakeholders so that voices are heard andconsensus is achieved.
Policy options and interventions:ñ Community participation in policy formulation and evaluationñ National health policies, strategies and plans promoting integrated people-centred health servicesñ Harmonization and alignment of donor programmes with national policies, strategies and plansñ Decentralization, where appropriate, to local level2.2 Enhancing mutual accountability:is essentially about answerability, and encompasses both the"rendering of the account", that is providing information about performance, and the "holding to account",meaning the provision of rewards and sanctions.
Strengthening accountability of health systems requiresjoint action by health and non-health sectors, public and private sectors, and citizens, towards a commongoal.Policy options and interventions:ñ Health rights and entitlementsñ Provider report cards, patient reported outcomes and balanced scorecardsñ Performance based financing and contractingñ Population registration with accountable care provider(s)Draft for consultation 13PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESReorienting the model of care means ensuring that efficient and effective health care services are purchasedand provided through models of care that prioritize primary and community care services and the co-production of health.
This encompasses the shift from inpatient to outpatient and ambulatory care.
Itrequires investment in holistic and comprehensive care, including health promotion and ill-health preventionstrategies that support people's health and well-being.
It requires both gender and cultural sensitivity.Reorienting models of care is also about creating new opportunities for intersectoral action at a community-level to address the social determinants of health and make the best use of scarce resources, including, attimes, partnerships with the private sector.3.1 Defining service priorities based on life-course needs and preferences:means appraising thepackage of health services offered at different levels of the care delivery system, covering the entire life-course.
It uses a blend of methods to understand both the particular needs and preferences of the populationand how decisions fit within a holistic approach to health care.
It also includes health technology assessment.Policy options and interventions:ñ Local health needs assessmentñ Comprehensive package of services for all population groupsñ Gender and cultural sensitive servicesñ Health technology assessment3.2 Revaluing promotion, prevention and public health:means placing increased emphasis and resources onpromotive, preventive and public health services.
Public health systems include all public, private, and voluntaryentities that contribute to the delivery of essential public health functions (EPHF) within a defined territory.Policy options and interventions:ñ Monitoring health status of the populationñ Surveillance, research and control of risks and threats to public health ñ Health promotion and disease preventionñ Public health regulation and enforcement3.3 Building strong primary care-based systems:strong primary care services are essential for reachingthe entire population and guaranteeing universal access to services.
It involves ensuring adequate funding,appropriate training, and connections to other services and sectors.
It promotes coordination and continuouscare over time for people with complex health problems, facilitating intersectoral action in health.
It employsinter-professional teams to ensure the provision of comprehensive services for all.
It prioritizes communityand family-oriented models of care as a mainstay of practice.Policy options and interventions:ñ Primary care services with a family and community-based approachñ Multidisciplinary primary care teamsñ Gatekeeping to access other specialized servicesñ Greater proportion of health expenditure allocated to primary care3.4 Shifting towards more outpatient and ambulatory care:service substitution is the process ofreplacing some forms of care with those that are more efficient for the health system.
The objective is to findthe right balance between primary care, other specialized outpatient care and hospital inpatient care,recognizing that each has an important role in the health care delivery ecosystem.Strategic Goal 3.
Reorienting the model of careDraft for consultation 14 WHO GLOBAL STRATEGY ON INTEGRATED PEOPLE-CENTRED HEALTH SERVICES 2016-2026.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYPolicy options and interventions:ñ Home care, nursing homes and hospicesñ Repurposing hospitals for acute complex care onlyñ Outpatient surgery, day hospital and progressive patient care3.5 Innovating and incorporating new technologies:rapid technological change is enabling thedevelopment of increasingly innovative care models.
New information and communication technologiesallow new types of information integration and sharing.
When used appropriately, they can assure continuityof information, track quality, and reach geographically isolated communities.Policy options and interventions:ñ E-health and m-health Strategic Goal 4: Coordinating servicesCoordinating services involves coordinating care around the needs and preferences of people at every levelof care, as well as promoting activities to integrate different health care providers and create effectivenetworks between health and other sectors.
Coordination does not necessarily require the merging of thedifferent structures, services or workflows, but rather focuses on improving the delivery of care through thealignment and harmonizing of the processes of the different services.
4.1 Coordinating care for individuals:coordination of care is not a single activity, but rather a range ofstrategies that can help to achieve better continuity of care and enhance the patient's experience withservices, particularly during care transitions.
The focal point for improvement is the delivery of care to theindividual, with services coordinated around their needs and those of their families.
It is also about improvedinformation flows and maintaining trustworthy relationships with providers over time.
Policy options and interventions:ñ Shared electronic medical recordñ Care pathwaysñ Referral and counter-referral systemsñ Case management4.2 Coordinating health programmes and providers:includes bridging the administrative, informationaland funding barriers between health care sectors and between providers.
This involves sector componentssuch as pharmaceutical and product safety regulators, information technology teams working with diseasesurveillance systems, allied health teams delivering treatment plans in collaboration with each other, disease-specific laboratory services linked to broader services improvement and provider networks focused on closerrelationships in patient care.Policy options and interventions:ñ Regional or district-based health service delivery networksñ Integrating vertical programmes into national health systemsñ Incentives for care coordination4.3 Coordinating across sectors: successful coordination involves multiple actors, both within and beyondthe health sector.
It encompasses sectors such as social services, education, labour, housing, traditional andcomplementary medicine, and the private sector, among others.
It also entails coordination for earlydetection and rapid response to health crises.
Draft for consultation 15PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESPolicy options and interventions:ñ Intersectoral partnershipsñ Merging of health sector with social servicesñ Integrating traditional and complementary medicine with modern health systemsñ Coordinating with preparedness, detection and response to health crisesStrategic Goal 5: Creating an enabling environmentIn order for the four previous strategies to become an operational reality, it is necessary to create anenabling environment that brings together the different stakeholders to undertake transformational change.This is a complex task involving a diverse set of processes to bring about the necessary changes in legislativeframeworks, financial arrangements and incentives, and the reorientation of the workforce and public policy-making.5.1 Strengthening leadership and management for change:strong leadership and vision are critical tosuccessful change management within a health system.
Establishing a strong policy framework and acompelling narrative for reform will be important to building a shared vision, as well as setting out how thatvision will be achieved.
Development of an organizational culture that supports monitoring and evaluation,knowledge sharing and a demand for data in decision-making is also a prerequisite for transformationalchange.Policy options and interventions:ñ Transformational and distributed leadershipñ Dedicating resources for reformñSystems research and knowledge sharing5.2 Striving for quality improvement and safety:institutions and providers need to strive constantly forquality improvement and safety.
These efforts include both technical and perceived quality.Policy options and interventions:ñ Clinical governanceñ Quality assurance and continuous quality improvement5.3 Reorienting the health workforce:special attention needs to be given to reorienting the healthworkforce to meet the requirements of service delivery reforms.
It requires health workers to approachpatients, users and communities differently, be more open to working in teams, use data more effectively andbe willing to innovate in their practice.
Policy options and interventions:ñ Health workforce trainingñ Multi-professional teams working across organizational boundariesñ Improving working conditions and compensation mechanisms5.4 Aligning regulatory frameworks:regulation plays a key role in establishing the rules within whichprofessionals and organizations must operate within more people-centred and integrated health systems –for example, in terms of setting new quality standards and/or paying against performance targets.Policy options and interventions:ñ Aligning regulatory frameworkDraft for consultation 16 WHO GLOBAL STRATEGY ON INTEGRATED PEOPLE-CENTRED HEALTH SERVICES 2016-2026.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY5.5 Reforming payment systems:changes in the way care is funded and paid for are also needed to promotethe right mix of financial incentives in a system that supports the integration of care between providers andsettings.
Policy options and interventions:ñ Mixed payment models based on capitationñ Bundled paymentsImplementation principlesIn moving forward with a strategy of this nature, it is important to acknowledge the lessons of history: thesuccessful reorientation of health services will most likely be a long journey requiring sustained politicalcommitment.
Ultimately, each country or local jurisdiction needs to set its own goals for integrated andpeople-centred health services, and develop its own strategy for achieving these goals.
The goals mustrespond to the local context, existing barriers and the values held by people within the state or area, andshould be achievable given the current health service delivery system, and the financial and political resourcesavailable to support change.
The implementation principles therefore of this strategy are the following:Country-led:strategies for pursuing integrated people-centred health services should be developed and ledby countries, with external support where necessary, and should respond to local conditions and contexts.Equity-focused:efforts to enhance equity are a necessary part of people-centred and integrated health carestrategies.
Efforts can target immediate factors driving inequitable service utilization, but may also addressmore fundamental social determinants.
Participatory:the notion of people-centred and integrated health services puts informed and empoweredpeople at the centre of the health system.
Therefore, processes to develop national strategies for suchservices should ensure accountability to local stakeholders and, especially, to disadvantaged populations.Systems strengthening:service delivery depends on effective information and financing systems, and theavailability of skilled and motivated health workers.
Changes made to service delivery will inevitably haveramifications across the entire health system.
Iterative learning/action cycles:success is most likely when there are iterative learning and action cycles thattrack changes in the service delivery system, identify emerging problems and bring stakeholders together tosolve problems.
Goal-oriented:a key focus of the strategy should be on the ongoing monitoring of progress within aframework that includes specific and measurable objectives.
The role of key stakeholdersCountries:moves towards people-centred and integrated health services need to be country-led in a processof co-production between governments, providers and the people that they serve.
The role of countries istherefore essential in overcoming some of the key challenges to implementation.
Countries committed tothis path should be sure to develop and communicate a clear vision and strategy for what they wish toachieve.
They also need to secure adequate funding for reform and implementation research.Development partners:should, except under exceptional circumstances where very rapid or unique action isrequired, seek to integrate their support to health service delivery into countries' own health systems.
Theycan also help to share technical knowledge about different approaches to promoting more people-centredand integrated services.Draft for consultation 17PLACING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AT THE CENTRE OF HEALTH SERVICESCitizens' groups:various networks have an important role to play in advocating for more people-centred andintegrated health services, as well as in empowering their members to be able to better manage their ownhealth concerns and engage with the health system.Academics and researchers:have an important role to play in providing analytical, educational andimplementation skills.
Understanding of strategies to support people-centred and integrated health servicesneeds to be enhanced through health systems research and implementation research efforts.Provider associations:can play important roles in adopting and endorsing new practices, and in providingsupport to their members.WHO:the role of WHO will be to drive policies that can support the development of people-centred andintegrated health services across the world.
The adoption of integrated people-centred health services, andthe five key strategic goals identified in this strategy, will therefore require sustained advocacy and technicalcooperation efforts.
Progress monitoringIn order to track overall progress in the implementation of this strategy, and the progress of each one of itsfive strategic goals, the below set of six indicators is being proposed.
After agreement is reached on theirusefulness to track implementation progress, specific baselines for 2016 and targets for 2026 will bedeveloped.Draft for consultation 18 WHO GLOBAL STRATEGY ON INTEGRATED PEOPLE-CENTRED HEALTH SERVICES 2016-2026.
